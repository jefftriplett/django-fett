# Django Fett

Django Fett is an incomplete code generator used on several projects. 
This is an attempt to clean it up and make it public for consumption.

Django Fett is different because it leverages Frontmatter Metadata and exposes the extra metadata into the template context.
Frontmatter Metadata may also contain variables that make setting an output filename cleaner than trying to save file or folder names with Jinja syntax.
